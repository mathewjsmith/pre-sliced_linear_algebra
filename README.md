# Pre-Sliced Linear Algebra
This project is inspired by the "Slicing and Dicing" representation of linear algebra algorithms as presented in the ![Linear Algebra: Foundations to Frontiers](http://ulaff.net/index.html) series of MOOC's from the University of Texas. The goal is to implement the slicing and dicing method in a library which can be used to experiment with and implement linear algebra algorithms in a way which is boilerplate free and highly expressive.
